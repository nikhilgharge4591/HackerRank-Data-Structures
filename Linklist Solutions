        current = current.next
        index +=1
    current.next = current.next.next
    return head
    
    
    Reverse a llist
    
    def reversePrint(head):
    if head == None:
        return
    reversePrint(head.next)
    print(head.data)


Reverse a Linklist

    while current is not None:
